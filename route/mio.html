                Hi babe :D<br>

Three months ago, on this day, we embarked on a wonderful journey together. Feels like it was just moments ago when I asked you if you’d like to go out with me. I remember how stressed out I was, and how hard I tried not to show it, how nervous I was when you said you needed time, and how I held my breath as I opened your chat the following morning… and here we are now, after having been for three months together. We’ve talked about so many things, and for so long every day, and yet I know that we can still just sit down and feel the same thrill we used to talk with, the same happiness and joy lighting our eyes up. In our conversations, we have been from Hong Kong to Macau, from going for a date at the Avenue of Stars to roaming around the parks and trails. We have been through thick and thin, and have always tried to support each other. We’ve always done our best to be there for each other, and we’ve always been true to each other. You are the first person who made me feel comfortable being the way I am. Babe, you’ve dealt with so many versions of me haha, from sad me to angry me to happy me to high me to 5-yr-old me :P. Thank you so much for standing by my side love. And I am really sorry for all the mistakes I have made and for everything I have done that has hurt you. I may not be the best boyfriend, but I am gonna try my best to be the person you deserve. You’re my angel and my sunshine babe. You are the reason I feel like waking up when I feel low, you’re the source of my inspiration and motivation. Your smile is so cute aww, it lights up my universe! Your eyes have this warmth, which just feels like home. And your heart is my home. Your cute little drama, your adorable kissies, and your love which is so pure…. You’re the person I dreamt of being with since I was a kid! And now I’m with her! I’m the luckiest guy in the whole wide world my sweetheart, and you’re the reason. You made me believe in myself, and you made me rise above my bad memories. Babe, you made me feel alive again, and there is no way I can ever express my gratitude to you. You’re my cutie little baby, and I love you the most! Happy three months babe! 

<br>
Yours forever,<br>
Mio :3
